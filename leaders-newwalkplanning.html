				<h3>The old walks planning system has been disabled</h3>
				<p>As I said in Spring, I have now replaced the old walk planning system with a new one. Adding walks with the new system is mostly similar to the old system, but you will need to log in again. I've set up accounts for all active walk leaders in the old system with an email address, and in most cases your password will be the same as before. If you can't log in to the new system, please <a href="mailto:sheffieldwalkinggroup@hotmail.com">email the group</a>.</p>
				<p>To access the new system, go to <a href="http://www.sheffieldwalkinggroup.org.uk/login">http://www.sheffieldwalkinggroup.org.uk/login</a> and enter your username and password (as on the old system). You will see a new "Leaders" menu at the bottom left, with a "Walk planning" link. If you click that link, you'll get a list of walks you've already led, with the option to view or edit them. To add a new walk, click "Suggest a walk" on that page, or "Add new walk" in the menu. The add/edit walk page is mostly the same as before, though some things have moved around.</p>
				<p>The main change is that a map is now available for the start and end points, and you can upload the route if you planned the walk on the computer - more details are available on the new walk page. The map is linked to the start and end points, so <b>there is no need to look up grid references</b>. If you enter a grid reference, a marker will appear on the map so you can check it's correct. If you move the map into place and click "Place here", a marker will be added at the centre of the map. You can then drag the marker around. In some cases, the map will automatically look up a place name for you when you place a marker, but it won't overwrite a place name you've written yourself. You can search for places on the map if you like: towns and villages usually come up easily; if you're searching a building, it may be useful to include the type of building (for example, search for 'Ladybower inn' rather than 'Ladybower').</p>
				<p>If you plan your walks on the computer, or recce them with a GPS unit, you can export the route (or track) in GPX format and upload that here. GPX is a standard format that should be available with any route planning software you have, and if not there are plenty of ways to convert to GPX. When you upload a route, the start and end points are set to the start and end of the route, and the length is calculated (avoiding the usual inaccuracy from using string). By default, the route will be displayed on the walk's map, and in future it will be available for other leaders or members to download. If you don't want this, change the option under "Route visibility".</p>
